# sign-up-form
This is a test sign-up form using CSS Pseudo-classes, and other elements. The goal is to attain a fully functioning page that validates the data visually on the frontend, before sending it to the backend. 
For obvious reasons, this will not have any form of an attempt to validate, obfuscate, or hash passwords - as this is purely a front-end test project.
